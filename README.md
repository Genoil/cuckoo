Cuckoo Cycle is the first graph-theoretic proof-of-work,
and by far the most memory bound, with memory latency
dominating the mining runtime, yet with instant verification.

Proofs take the form of a length 42 cycle in a bipartite graph
with N nodes and N/2 edges, with N scalable from millions to billions and beyond.

This makes verification trivial: compute the 42x2 edge endpoints
with one initialising sha256 and 84 very cheap siphash-2-4 hashes,
check that each endpoint occurs twice, and that you come back to the
starting point only after traversing 42 edges
(this also makes Cuckoo Cycle, unlike Hashcash, relatively immune from Grover's quantum search algorithm).

A final sha256 hash on the sorted 42 nonces can check whether the 42-cycle meets a difficulty target.

This is implemented in just 157 lines of C code (files src/cuckoo.h and src/cuckoo.c).

From this point of view, Cuckoo Cycle is a very simple PoW,
requiring hardly any code, time, or memory to verify.

Finding a 42-cycle, on the other hand, is far from trivial,
requiring considerable resources, and some luck
(for a given header, the odds of its graph having a 42-cycle are about 2.5%).

Where Satoshi Nakamoto aimed for "one-CPU-one-vote", Cuckoo Cycle aims for
1 memory bank + 1 virtual core = 1 vote
--------------

The algorithm implemented in cuckoo_miner.h runs in time linear in N.
(Note that running in sub-linear time is out of the question, as you could
only compute a fraction of all edges, and the odds of all 42 edges of a cycle
occurring in this fraction are astronomically small).

Memory-wise, it uses N/2 bits to maintain a subset of all edges (potential cycle edges)
and N additional bits (or N/2^k bits with corresponding slowdown)
to trim the subset in a series of edge trimming rounds.
This is the phase that takes the vast majority of (latency dominated) runtime.

Once the subset is small enough, an algorithm inspired by Cuckoo Hashing
is used to recognise all cycles, and recover those of the right length.

The runtime of a single proof attempt on a high end x86 is 5.5min/GB single-threaded, or 1.5min/GB for 8 threads.

I claim that this implementation is a reasonably optimal Cuckoo miner,
secondly, that trading off memory for running time, as implemented in tomato_miner.h,
incurs at least one order of magnitude extra slowdown,
and finally, that cuda_miner.cu is a reasonably optimal GPU miner.
The latter runs about 4x-5x faster on an NVIDA GTX 980 than on an Intel Core-i7 CPU. 
To that end, I offer the following bounties:

CPU Speedup Bounty
--------------
$500 for an open source implementation that finds 42-cycles twice as fast, possibly using more memory.

Linear Time-Memory Trade-Off Bounty
--------------
$500 for an open source implementation that uses at most N/k bits while running up to 15 k times slower,
for any k>=2.

Both of these bounties require N ranging over {2^28,2^30,2^32} and #threads ranging over {1,2,4,8},
and further assume a high-end Intel Core i7 or Xeon and recent gcc compiler with regular flags as in my Makefile.

GPU Speedup Bounty
--------------
$500 for an open source implementation for a consumer GPU combo
that finds 42-cycles twice as fast as cuda_miner.cu on comparable hardware.
Again with N ranging over {2^28,2^30,2^32}.

These bounties are to expire at the end of 2016. They are admittedly modest in size, but then
claiming them might only require one or two insightful tweaks to my existing implementations.

I invite anyone who'd like to see my claims refuted to extend any of these bounties
with amounts of your crypto-currency of choice.

(I don't have any crypto-currencies to offer myself, but if need be, I might be able to convert
a bounty through a trusted 3rd party)

Happy bounty hunting!
